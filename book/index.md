The Web3 Foundation “Blockchain for Beginners” MOOC teaches blockchain from the very basics all the way up to building your own blockchain. The course is led by Bill Laboon, Web3 Foundation’s technical education lead.

Beginning with the fundamentals - What is a blockchain? How is it stored? What are the different algorithms and protocols that are used in a blockchain? What’s the history of blockchain technology? It goes from absolute zero knowledge of blockchain or cryptography all the way to showing how to produce actual products on blockchain.
